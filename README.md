# Ciphers
Multiple Ciphers with C 
MCC is a project completely developed using c programming language. The code is simple and easy to understand, since it was developed on beginner's knowledge.
It has four features in total and they are : 
* Morse Code
* Caesar Cipher
* Vigenere Cipher
* Symbolic Fun.

All these features are developed using simple/basic knowledge on cryptography( the art of encrypting and decrypting data ). 
Almost all the ciphers used in this project are substitution ciphers in which symbolic fun is the one which our team came up with. It basically substitutes alphabets to random symbols on the keyboard.

1. MORSE CODE:

               This is a function where the text provided by the user is encrypted by substituting the albhabets with its respective morse code(dits"....." & dashes"----").
    
2. CAESAR CIPHER:

               This cipher is also a substitution cipher where the user's text/input is substituted with an alphabet with respect to the key...i.e. if the key is 3, then "a" is swapped with "d", "b" is swapped with "e" and so on...
   
3. Vigenere Cipher:

               This is a bit advance than the other cipher algorithms used. Vigenere Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text. It uses a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. A polyalphabetic cipher is any cipher based on substitution, using multiple substitution alphabets. The encryption of the original text is done using the Vigenère square or Vigenère table.

4. SYMBOLIC FUN:

               The symbolic fun algo swaps random symbols assigned to the respective alphabet and encrypts the text.
